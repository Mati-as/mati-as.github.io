My cat Ari cries like crazy on sunny days, asking me to open the window. I open it thinking, “Guess she wants to go out on the terrace.” But nope—she just sits on the windowsill staring at the sky.
My other cat, Pinshi, also looks at the sky sometimes, but he watches people walking by or birds flying. Ari though… she's just staring at the sky.
What is she looking at?
I like to think she’s imagining something she loves while looking up there. Like a kid holding a helium balloon, gazing at it as it floats.
